### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hi there, I'm Mauricio. My major is on Actuarial Sciences and I am currently working as an infrastructure Analyst in CitiBanamex but just as a title, I do automation on processes and a little bit of machine learning for stability management. I'm in the process of learning TensorFlow in order to implement Neural Networks. 

I am looking forward to collaborate on any Machine Learning/AI project, you can contact me at this email: mauriciobglez@gmail.com
